RTLola is a runtime monitoring framework.  It consists of a parser, analyzer, and interpreter for the RTLola specification language.
This crate contains macros relevant for using your own type as an input to the interpreter.

# Interpreter Macros
This crate contains macros relevant for using your own type as an input to the interpreter. I.e. it contains a derive macro that implements `Record` for a given type such that the monitor can parse an event from it.
