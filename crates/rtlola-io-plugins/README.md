RTLola is a runtime monitoring framework.  It consists of a parser, analyzer, and interpreter for the RTLola specification language.
This crate contains an Api to the interpreter capable of reading csv and pcap files.
It also provides an interface to parse and serialize bytes given to and coming from the `rtlola-interpreter`.

# IO Plugins

This crate contains multiple input and output plugins to be used with the `rtlola-interpreter`.
Right now, it supports CSV, PCAP files, and a Byte Plugin to parse and serialize byte streams.
Each plugin (or input/output method) is marked with a feature flag, so only the needed input/output variants can be included.
