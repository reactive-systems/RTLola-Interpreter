RTLola is a runtime monitoring framework.  It consists of a parser, analyzer, and interpreter for the RTLola specification language.
This crate contains a CLI interface to the interpreter capable of reading csv and pcap files.

# Input Plugins
This crate contains multiple input plugins to be used with the `rtlola-interpreter`.
Right now, it supports CSV and PCAP files.
Each plugin (or input method) is marked with a feature flag, so only the needed input variants can be included.
By default, all input plugins are included.
