RTLola is a monitoring framework. This library crate provides two APIs to evaluate RTLola specifications through interpretation.
If you are looking for a ready to use tool try out the `rtlola-cli` crate, which provides a command line interface to the interpreter capable of parsing csv and pcap files.
